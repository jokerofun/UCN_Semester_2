For this project my group contacted a company dealing in production of machinery and up until then they had been using pen&paper to do their daily assignments. 
So we took the task to develop a brand new system featuring a responsive GUI and a highly complex scheduler that will prioritize the work of both employees and on-site machines.
The project was done entirely on Java (+ Swing for GUI) and msSQL for database.
